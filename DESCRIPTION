Description: The TERM package performs an integrative analysis of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data with the multi-layer network framework. It constructs a two-layer differential co-expression networks based on the differential expression of mRNAs and ribosome footprints (RFPs). Translational Efficiency Regulated Modules (TERMs) are extracted by multi-layer networks clustering with statistically significant differential translated genes as seeds for searching.
